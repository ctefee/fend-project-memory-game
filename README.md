# Memory Game

This project requires you to explore and learn more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The memory game is a basic matching game to test the player's memory. In a deck of paired cards, the player needs to match each pair to win the game. There are sixteen cards arranged randomly and each card is provided with different symbols hidden behind the deck.

## Getting Started
* Run it locally: clone/download this repository. 
* Open fend-project-memory-game.html in your browser.

## Project's Goals

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched!
